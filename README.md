# How it works?

1. A number "x" is chosen
  - x is a natural number greater than zero

2. Eder's Algorithm
  - A random number between 1 and x is picked and put into an array
  - The above process is repeated until the array has all numbers from 1 to x
  - the length of this array is called "y"

3. If we repeat Eder's Algorithm infinite times, we will have infinite different y's

4. The average of all the infinite y's is called Edr(x)
